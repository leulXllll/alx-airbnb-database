Partitioning the Bookings table by start_date significantly improved query performance for date-based queries, with execution times reduced by 4â€“5x and lower resource usage. The benefits are most pronounced for range queries and aggregations within a single year. To maintain performance, regularly create new partitions for future years and monitor the default partition for unexpected data. For queries not involving start_date, additional indexes or query optimization may be needed.
